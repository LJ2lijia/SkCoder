## Dataset

### AixBench-L

AixBench-L is a function-level code generation benchmark and is collected by this work. We treat the original [AixBench](https://github.com/aixcoder-plugin/nl2code-dataset) as the test data and collect lots of natural langage-code pairs pairs from Github as the train and dev data. The dataset can be found in this [link](https://github.com/aixcoder-plugin/AixBench-L).
